<!--  Create a basic html page without any CSS styling to it, the page should have at least 10 elements on it.

Use jQuery to animate the elements, you can for instance use hide(), show(),fadeIn(),fadeOut(),slideToggle()...etc. You should have at least 5 different effects happen.

You must also have at least 3 different events handlers as well (you can choose for instance click,hover and mouseEnter but you're free to use others if you want).

If you've forgotten what events are, check out this page: https://learn.jquery.com/events/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Finally, upload your solution on Github and submit the URL.

Succes! ;) -->
